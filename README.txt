# INSTALLATION
Run "brew install postgresql". This might not be necessary yet
Then run "pip install -r requirements.txt" from inside the broadcastr directory
That should install everything this needs.
Then, run "python app.py" to launch the website and go to the IP it tells you to (for me, and probably for you, it's http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
