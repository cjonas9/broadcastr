# INSTALLATION
Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" from inside the broadcastr directory
That should install everything this needs.
Then, run "python app.py" to launch the website and go to the IP it tells you to (for me, and probably for you, it's http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

frontend: from website278 folder
First time:
Make sure youâ€™re using node v20, if not run nvm install 20 run npm install
Next times:
Run "npm run dev", it will be hosted on localhost:5000
